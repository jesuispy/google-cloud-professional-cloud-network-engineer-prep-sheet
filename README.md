> Please note this is not a dump and won't make much sense if you don't know anything about Networking in Google Cloud. I recommend this prep sheet only after your formal training and labbing is completed and before you are ready to take the exam. This sheet helps you to focus (no knowledge overload) to bring you up to exam readiness.
